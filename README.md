# music-routing

This is a solver for Six Degrees Of Kevin Bacon, but for music.

But really, it's just a way to demonstrate the worker_threads module in Node.js.

An early version of this was used as the demo code in

I'll probably inch along into something more generally fun/usable. Or not? I
don't know. Pull requests to do that are, of course, welcome.
