# music-routing

This is a solver for Six Degrees Of Kevin Bacon, but for music.

But really, it's just a way to demonstrate Node.js
[worker_threads](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html).

An early version of this was used as the demo code in
[a post I wrote](https://medium.com/@Trott/using-worker-threads-in-node-js-part-2-a9405c72a6f0).

I'll probably inch along into something more generally fun/usable. Or not? I
don't know. Pull requests to do that are, of course, welcome.

Run `npm start` (after you've done `npm install` one time) to run a webserver (default localhost port 8080).
